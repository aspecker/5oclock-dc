        About Us
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>5 O' Clock DC</strong> started from the simple desire to enjoy drinks with good people. The creators of 5 O' Clock built something they wanted to use, and wanted to share it with other DC locals. We built 5 O'Clock DC with the consideration that happy hour is often an elusive and missed opportunity, but weâ€™ve changed that. We take advantage of DC's growing restaurant scene and find you the best happy hours. Find your happy place with us.
